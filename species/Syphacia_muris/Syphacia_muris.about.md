The nematode _Syphacia muris_, or rat pinworm, is a parasite of rats.\n\nThe nematode _Syphacia muris_ (Nematoda: Oxyuridae) is a ubiquitous nematode that commonly infects laboratory rodents (mainly rats). The direct transmission of this gastrointestinal nematode by contaminated food, water and bedding facilitates transmission in animal holdings. This results in continual re-exposure to the parasite, making the control of pinworms quite difficult and rodent colonies are frequently infected. _Syphacia muris_ inhabits the caecum and the colon of the host.
