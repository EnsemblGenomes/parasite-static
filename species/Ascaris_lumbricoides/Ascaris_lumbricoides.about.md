The nematode _Ascaris lumbricoides_, or human large roundworm, infects the small intestine of humans. Transmitted through ingestion of faecally-contaminated soil and water, it is most prevalent in areas where sanitation is poor and has a worldwide distribution.  _A. lumbricoides_ is the most common human parasitic infection, responsible for an estimated billion infections. Infections with _A. lumbricoides_ is often asymptomatic and pathology is related to parasite burden. Heavily infected children may suffer poor appetite, growth stunting, and non-specific abdominal symptoms. Ascariasis is a common cause of acute surgical emergencies when obstruction of the intestine is caused by boluses of parasites or of the biliary system by the the aberrant migration of parasites.\n
