The gene predictions were made by the [ Davis laboratory at the University of Colorado ](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Faculty/PrimaryFaculty/Pages/Davis.aspx) based on the output of [ TransDecoder ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875132/). A correction was submitted by the authors in 2018 for release 11 of WormBase ParaSite. Release 15 saw the addition of 10 gene models curated as part of the study of the _P. univalens_ P-glycoprotein repertoire at [The Free University of Berlin](https://www.vetmed.fu-berlin.de/).
