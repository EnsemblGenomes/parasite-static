The cestode _Echinococcus multilocularis_ is a member of the Cyclophyllidea, which comprise the majority of tapeworms that are of medical importance. The disease alveolar echinococcosis, which is caused by the larval stage of _E. multilocularis_, is considered to be one of the most dangerous worm infections in the world. _E.Â multilocularis_ has recently spread in Europe, Japan, and North America to areas that were previously free of the parasite leading to the classification of alveolar echinococcosis as an emerging zoonosis.
