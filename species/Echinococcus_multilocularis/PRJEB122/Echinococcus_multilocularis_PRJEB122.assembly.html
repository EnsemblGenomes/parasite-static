The <em>E.&nbsp;multilocularis</em> reference genome was sequenced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> in collaboration with Klaus Brehm (University of WÃÂ¼rzburg). The initial version of the genome was described in <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966/">Tsai et al (2013)</a>. The assembly has subsequently been improved, and the version represented here since ParaSite release 5 (January 2016) is NCBI <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000469725.3">EMULTI002 </a>.
