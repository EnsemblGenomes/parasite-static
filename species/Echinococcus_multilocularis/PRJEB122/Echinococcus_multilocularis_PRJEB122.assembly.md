The _E. multilocularis_ reference genome was sequenced by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) in collaboration with Klaus Brehm (University of WÃÂÃÂ¼rzburg). The initial version of the genome was described in [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966/). The assembly has subsequently been improved, and the version represented here since ParaSite release 5 (January 2016) is NCBI [EMULTI002 ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000469725.3).
