The original gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) as described by [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966/). The gene models have since been subject to iterative improvement, and version represented since ParaSite version 5 (January 2016) here is the [November 2015 snapshot](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Echinococcus/multilocularis/genome/).
