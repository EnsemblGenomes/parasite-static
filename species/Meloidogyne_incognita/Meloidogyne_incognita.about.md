The nematode _Meloidogyne incognita_, also known as the southern root-knot nematode, is able to infect the roots of almost all cultivated plants. It is an obligatory sedentary parasite that reproduces by mitotic parthenogenesis. _M. incognita_ can infect _ArabidopsisÂ thaliana_, making it a key model system for the understanding of metazoan adaptations to plant parasitism.
