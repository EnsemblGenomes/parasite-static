The nematode _Bursaphelenchus okinawaensis_, is self-fertilizing, hermaphroditic, fungus-feeding and has been used as a laboratory model for the genus _Bursaphelenchus_, which includes the important plant pathogen _Bursaphelenchus xylophilus_. _B. xylophilus_ infects trees in the _Pinus_ genus of coniferous trees and causes the disease pine wilt, comprising a serious threat to Asian and European conifer forests.
