_Caenorhabditis zanzibari_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 26_) was formally described by [Stevens et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. Molecular data suggests its nearest relatives are _C. sinica_ and _C. tribulationis_.  It reproduces through males and females. The species type isolate was collected from a rotting mandarin fruit in Zanzibar, Tanzania, in 2012.
