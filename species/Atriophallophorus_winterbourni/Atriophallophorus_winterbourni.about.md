The trematode _Atriophallophorus winterbourni_, or _Microphallus sp./Microphallus livelyi_, is a digenean parasite with a multihost life cycle, native to the lakes of New Zealand. In the beginning of its life cycle, _A. winterbourni_ develops in the gut of a mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), while the adult worm stage occurs in the gut of waterfowl, where the worms reproduce sexually. _A. winterbourni_ is not known to infect humans and has low virulence in its final bird host.
