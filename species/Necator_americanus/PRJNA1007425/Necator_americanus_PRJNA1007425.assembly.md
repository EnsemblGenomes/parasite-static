
The wild-type reference strain Aroian of the major human hookworm Necator americanus was sequenced using long-read sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), short-read sequencing technology 
(Illumina sequencing) and Illumina for Hi-C chromosomal scaffolding (Dovetail/Cantata Omni-C). These reads have been assembled into a chromosomally scaffolded genome. This genome was provided by [Erich Schwarz](https://cals.cornell.edu/erich-schwarz), [College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/).
