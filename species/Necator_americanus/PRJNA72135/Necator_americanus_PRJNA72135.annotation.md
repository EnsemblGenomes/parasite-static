The gene predictions for this assembly were drastically updated in WBPS17 by [Centre for Molecular Therapeutics, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/cmt), as described by [Logan et al (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32453752/). Gene models were generated using the [MAKER pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280279/). Publicly available RNASeq data, protein sequences from [SwissProt UniRef100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210571/) and WormBase ParaSite for a set of related species and previously generated models by [Tang et. al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978129/) and _ab initio_ gene predictions were provided to MAKER and [BRAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078167/) to boost the annotation process. Final gene models were created using [GeneMark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4150757/) and [Augustus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18218656) within BRAKER.
