The gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) and WormBase, as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. An in-house pipeline was developed that used [MAKER](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575) to generate high-quality annotations by integrating evidence from multiple sources: ab initio gene predictions from [AUGUSTUS](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16845043), [GeneMark-ES](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18757608), and [SNAP](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15144565); projected annotation from _C.Â elegans_ (using [GenBlastG](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21653517)) and the taxonomically nearest reference helminth genome (using [RATT](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21306991)); and ESTs, mRNAs and proteins from related organisms aligned to the genome using BLAST, with refinement of alignments using [Exonerate](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15713233).
