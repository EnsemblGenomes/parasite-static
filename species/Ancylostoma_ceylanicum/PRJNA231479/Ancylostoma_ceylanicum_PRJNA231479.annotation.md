This set of gene annotations has been generated as part of a combined RNA-seq and excreted/secreted (ES) protein analysis carried out by Prof. Erich Schwarz at [Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/) in collaboration with Prof. Raffi Aroian at [UMass Chan Medical School](https://www.umassmed.edu/). This is a direct replacement of older gene predictions generated by [Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/), described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25730766">Schwarz et al (2015)</a>.
