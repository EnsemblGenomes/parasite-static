The gene predictions were made by the [Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/), and submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. The annotation was then updated by GIWU, as described in [Magrini et al (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29495964/), by incorporating PacBio cDNA data (available from release 12), and later by WormBase ParaSite (release 15) to incorporate missing gene models: here we present a version retrieved in January 2020 from [http://nematode.net](http://nematode.net).
