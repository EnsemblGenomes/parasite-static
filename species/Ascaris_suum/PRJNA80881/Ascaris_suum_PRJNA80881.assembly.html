The <em>A.&nbsp;suum</em> genome was sequenced by the <a href="http://www.gasserlab.org/">Gasser laboratory at the University of Melbourne</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22031327">Jex et al (2011)</a>. The version of the genome represented here is that submitted directly to WormBase in 2011, which is similar to, but not exactly the same as, NCBI assembly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000298755.1">GCA_000298755.1</a>.
