Strongylid nematode parasites infect the gastrointestinal tracts of both humans and other mammals, causing permanent growth deficits (e.g., for hookworm infections of humans) or outright death (e.g., for _Haemonchus contortus_ infections of sheep). Hookworms infect 170-440 million humans and other strongylids infect farm animals worldwide, making these among the most important parasites. The stronglyid parasite _Nippostrongylus brasiliensis_ naturally infects rats and easily infects laboratory mice, and has an infectious life cycle similar to that of human hookworms, making it an important laboratory model for hookworm disease; accordingly, _N. brasiliensis_ is often called "rat hookworm" or "rodent hookworm".
