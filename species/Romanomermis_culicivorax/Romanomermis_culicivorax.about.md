The nematode _Romanomermis culicivorax_ is an entomopathogenic parasite that invades larvae of various mosquito species killing these when emerging at the J4 stage. _R. culicivorax_ is being tested as a biological pest control to fight malaria. Although only distantly related to _C.Â elegans_ it has proved to be a particularly amenable study object for analyzing embryogenesis.
