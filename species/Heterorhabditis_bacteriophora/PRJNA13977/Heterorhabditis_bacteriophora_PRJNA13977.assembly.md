The _H.Â bacteriophora_ genome has been sequenced by Ohio State University and the [Genome Institute at Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/), as described by [Bai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23874975). The assembly version represented here is that submitted directly to WormBase, which is practically the same as NCBI assembly [GCA_000223415.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000223415.1) but contains a 23 additional scaffold that were not accepted by INSDC.
