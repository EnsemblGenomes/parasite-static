The cestode <i>Taenia multiceps</i> reproduces in dogs, wolves and foxes. In larval stage it parasitizes the brain or spinal cord of the intermediate host (sheep, goat and cattle) causing a disease named coneurosis. It has spread across most regions of the world, especially in developing countries in Africa and southeast Asia that are involved in the husbandry of sheep or goats. Coneurosis is also a zoonotic disease, which can lead to serious pathological conditions in humans.
