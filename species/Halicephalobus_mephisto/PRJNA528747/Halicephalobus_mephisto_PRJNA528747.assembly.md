As described in [Weinstein et al (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6872716/). A TruSeq library was paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 with 215â€‰bp reads. This data was assembled with [Platanus](http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp/). For PacBio, 30 lanes were run on the RS II system using libraries generated off the same DNA sample used in Illumina.
