The nematode _StrongyloidesÂ stercoralis_, or human threadworm, is a wide-spread, minute gastro-intestinal parasite of humans, occurring principally in the tropics and sub-tropics. Infection of immunosuppressed individuals can result in disseminated strongyloidiasis, in which worms occur throughout the body and can be fatal.
