The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with James B. Lok (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine), using Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction, followed by some bespoke manual improvement (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, [Hunt et al. (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753)).
