The gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, [Hunt et al. (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753). An in-house automatic pipeline (based around [AUGUSTUS](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15215400) plus [MAKER](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575)) was used to generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of targeted manual curation of selected gene families.
