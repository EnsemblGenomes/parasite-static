The gene predictions were made by the [Genome Informatics Facility, Office of Biotechnology, Iowa State University](https://www.biotech.iastate.edu/biotechnology-service-facilities/genome-informatics-facility/). Gene models were predicted using a [MIKADO](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=null&dbid=16&doi=10.1111%2F1755-0998.13432&key=10.1093%2Fgigascience%2Fgiy093) pipeline. Consensus transcripts from 7 transcriptom assemblies and gene predictions, previously published ESTs, previously published effectors and IsoSeq data were supplied with [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) to the pipeline as external evidence.
