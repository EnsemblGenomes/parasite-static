The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Genome Informatics Facility, Office of Biotechnology, Iowa State University](https://www.biotech.iastate.edu/biotechnology-service-facilities/genome-informatics-facility/). This is an updated version of the [GCA_004148225](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_004148225) assembly which uses PacBio long-read sequencing polished with Illumina HiSeq X short-read sequencing reads. Previously deposited Pacbio sequencing (SRX2692203 - SRX2692222) long reads were used with [Falcon](https://pb-falcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate a new draft assembly which was scaffolded using [SNAP read mapper](http://snap.cs.berkeley.edu/), [HiRise](https://github.com/DovetailGenomics/HiRise_July2015_GR) and [SSPACE-LONGREAD](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-211). [PILON](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=null&dbid=8&doi=10.1111%2F1755-0998.13432&key=25409509) was used to polish the assembly using the Illumina reads and CCS reads.
