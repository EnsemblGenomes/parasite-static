This annotated genome assembly [has been published](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/35939508).

The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C. The source material for genome sequencing was 20 adult male worms, originally obtained from Senegal in 1993, archived as part of the SCAN collection at the [Natural History 
Museum, London](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/), and provided by Fiona Allan, Aidan Emery and Muriel Rabone. Additional worms from the same collection were used for gene finding.
