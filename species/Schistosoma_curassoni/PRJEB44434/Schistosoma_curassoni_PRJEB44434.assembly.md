This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C. The source material for genome sequencing was 20 adult male worms, originally obtained from Senegal in 1993, archived as part of the SCAN collection at the [Natural History 
Museum, London](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/), and provided by Fiona Allan, Aidan Emery and Muriel Rabone. Additional worms from the same collection were used for gene finding.
