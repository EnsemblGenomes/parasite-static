<i>Caenorhabditis nigoni</i> is a male-female species in the Elegans group of the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> genus, first identified and described as "Caenorhabditis species 9" or "C. sp. 9" before being renamed as "Caenorhabditis nigoni". The specific epithet is a tribute to Victor Nigon who first studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in the laboratory with Ellsworth Dougherty in the 1940s.\n\n<i>C. nigoni</i> is noteworthy because it is very closely related to the hermaphroditic species <i>C. briggsae</i>. Despite substantial differences between <i>C. nigoni</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i> in their modes of sexual reproduction, their genome sizes, and their protein-coding gene counts, the two species can interbreed to produce not merely viable male and female hybrid offspring, but partially fertile female hybrid offspring.
