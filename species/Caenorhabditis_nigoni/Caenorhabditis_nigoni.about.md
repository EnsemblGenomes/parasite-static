_Caenorhabditis nigoni_ is a male-female species in the Elegans group of the _Caenorhabditis_ genus, first identified and described as "Caenorhabditis species 9" or "C. sp. 9" before being renamed as "Caenorhabditis nigoni". The specific epithet is a tribute to Victor Nigon who first studied _Caenorhabditis elegans_ in the laboratory with Ellsworth Dougherty in the 1940s.\n\n_C. nigoni_ is noteworthy because it is very closely related to the hermaphroditic species _C. briggsae_. Despite substantial differences between _C. nigoni_ and _C. briggsae_ in their modes of sexual reproduction, their genome sizes, and their protein-coding gene counts, the two species can interbreed to produce not merely viable male and female hybrid offspring, but partially fertile female hybrid offspring.
