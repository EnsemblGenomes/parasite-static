This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data, scaffolded using and Hi-C.
  
The source material for genome sequencing was a single worm from USA, sample prior to 2015, and provided by [Sam Loker](https://biology.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/loker_eric-s.html), [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu/), USA.
