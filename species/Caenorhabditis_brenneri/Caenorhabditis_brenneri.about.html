<i>Caenorhabditis brenneri</i> is a small, free-living round worm found in decaying plant material throughout the tropics. The worms feed on the bacteria and other micro-organisms associated with plant decay. The biology of <i>C. brenneri</i> is similar to that of <i>C. elegans</i> with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. <i>C.brenneri</i> has both male and female adults, unlike the hermaphroditic species such as <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i>.
