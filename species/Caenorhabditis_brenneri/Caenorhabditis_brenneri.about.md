_Caenorhabditis brenneri_ is a small, free-living round worm found in decaying plant material throughout the tropics. The worms feed on the bacteria and other micro-organisms associated with plant decay. The biology of _C. brenneri_ is similar to that of _C. elegans_ with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. _C.brenneri_ has both male and female adults, unlike the hermaphroditic species such as _C. elegans_ and _C. briggsae_.
