A transcriptome assembly of mixed-stage RNA-seq data from A. sudhausi was generated using the Trinity program (version 2.2.0, with the â€“normalize_reads option). The transcriptome assembly was then combined with community-curated gene annotations of P. pacificus (El Paco gene annotations version 3). The purpose of this was to create evidence-based gene annotations for A. sudhausi. Specifically, both datasets were aligned against the A. sudhausi assembly by the exonerate program (version 2.2.0) and processed by PPCAC software (version 1.0). The final gene annotations were assessed using BUSCO (version 3.0.1).
