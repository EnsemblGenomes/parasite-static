The free-living hermaphroditic nematode Allodiplogaster sudhausi is a member of the Diplogastridae family. It displays phenotypic plasticity, with a ploymorphism in its adult mouth-form leading to two distinct stomas of differing dimensions. Allodiplogaster sudhausi is also strikingly large compared to it's relatives.
