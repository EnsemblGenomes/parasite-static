The original gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) and WormBase, as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.
  
In June 2019 the predictions were improved by Alicia Costábile using [MAKER](https://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html) and incorporating additional evidence from RNASeq data, as described in [Costábile et al (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2018.03.010). 8367 original genes were updated and given new identifiers, and remaining 1311 gene models from the original annotation which were no longer predicted given new evidence and methodology were preserved unchanged. The update also contains 5076 new genes not present in the original annotation.
