Gene models were provided by [Laboratory of Nematology, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/laboratory-of-nematology.htm). Genes were predicted using the [BRAKER pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787252/). The prediction of gene models was aided by RNAseq datasets of different life stages of _G. rostochiensis_. All scripts used for generating the genome annotation are available [here](https://github.com/Jorisvansteenbrugge/GROS_genomes).
