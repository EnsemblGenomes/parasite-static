The genome assembly was produced by the [Laboratory of Nematology, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/laboratory-of-nematology.htm). The assembly uses PacBio SMRT sequencing complemented by 2 × 250 bp Illumina NovaSeq short-read sequencing. PacBio reads were assembled with [wtdgb2 v2.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004874/). Unmerged haplotigs were filtered from the assembly using [Purge Haplotigs v1.0.4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6267036/). The assembly was then tested for contamination using the [blobtools pipeline v.1.0.1](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.12232.1), while scaffolding performed with [SSPACE-Longread](https://github.com/Runsheng/sspace_longread). The Illumina reads were used to polish the assembly with [Arrow v2.3.3](https://github.com/) and [Pilon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237348/). All scripts used for the generation of the genome annotation are available [here](https://github.com/Jorisvansteenbrugge/GROS_genomes).
