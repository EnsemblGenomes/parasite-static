The full assembly process is described in [Lee et al., (2023)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10450198/). The Flye assembler (ver. 2.9.1) was used to assemble the raw ONT reads. These were then polished by four iterations of Racon (ver. 1.4.11), followed by Medaka (ver. 1.2.0; option: -m r941_min_sup_g507 or r103_sup_g507). The consensus sequences were further corrected with Illumina reads using NextPolish(ver. 1.4.0), and haplotigs were removed using HaploMerger2 (ver. 20180603).
