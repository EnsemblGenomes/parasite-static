The full annotation process is described in [Korhonen et al., (2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8894454/).
Annotation was achieved using [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) and sequence homology to proteins in the [Swiss-Prot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070428/), [KEGG58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245020/) and [NCBI NR59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245008/) databases using BLASTp (threshold E-value: ≤10−8).
