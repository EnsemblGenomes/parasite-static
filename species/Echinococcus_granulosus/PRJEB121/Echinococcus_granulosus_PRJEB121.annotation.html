The original gene predictions were made by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966/">Tsai et al (2013)</a>. The gene models have since been subject to iterative improvement, and the version represented here is the <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Echinococcus/granulosus/genome/">March 2013 snapshot</a>.
