The original gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) as described by [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966/). The gene models have since been subject to iterative improvement, and the version represented here is the [March 2013 snapshot](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Echinococcus/granulosus/genome/).
