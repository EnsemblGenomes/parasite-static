The genome assembly was produced by the [Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/), and submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.\n\nThe assembly presented here is similar, but not exactly equivalent to, the NCBI assembly [GCA_002352805.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_002352805.1), containing 5 additional scaffolds.
