_Cercopithifilaria johnstoni_ is a filarial nematode that is transmitted by hard ticks (Ixodidae) to infect a broad range of native Australian murid and marsupial hosts. Its ability to infect such a broad host range is unusual for a filarial parasite. _C. johnstoni_ infections can cause skin and ocular immunopathologies in native hosts and experimentally-infected laboratory rats that appear to be analogous to those seen in humans infected with related filarial parasite, [_Onchocerca volvulus_](https://parasite.wormbase.org/Onchocerca_volvulus_prjeb513).
