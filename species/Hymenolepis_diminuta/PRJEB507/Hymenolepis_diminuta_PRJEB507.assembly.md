The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with [Pete Olson](http://www.olsonlab.com/) (Natural History Museum, London) as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.using Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction.
