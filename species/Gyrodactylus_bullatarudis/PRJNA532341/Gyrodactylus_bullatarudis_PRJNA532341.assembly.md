The genome assembly was produced by the [Evolutionary Biology Group, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University](https://evobio.home.amu.edu.pl/). The assembly uses Illumina HiSeq4000 paired-end sequencing. The reads were assembled with [shovil pipeline 1.0-pre1](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill). Decontamination was performed using BLAST against UniRef90. Scaffolding was performed with [BESST](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-281). Gaps were filled with the [GAPCLOSER](https://vcru.wisc.edu/simonlab/bioinformatics/programs/soap/GapCloser_Manual.pdf) software. The mitochondrial genome was assembled with [mitobim](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23661685/).
