The cestode _HymenolepisÂ nana_, or dwarf tapeworm (previously known as Vampirolepis nana, Hymenolepis fraterna, and Taenia nana) is a cosmopolitan species most common in temperate zones. It is most often seen in children in countries in which sanitation and hygiene are inadequate and causes hymenolepiasis which rarely has symptoms.
