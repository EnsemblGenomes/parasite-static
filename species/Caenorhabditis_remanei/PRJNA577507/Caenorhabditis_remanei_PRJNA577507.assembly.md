This is a chromosome-level genome assembly of the _C. remanei_ PX506 inbred strain created from a wild isolate from an isopod collected in a forest near Toronto (Canada) [Teterina et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32111628/). The assembly was generated with PacBio long reads ([SRX6989873](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX6989873?show=reads), [SRX6989874](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX6989874?show=reads)) and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data ([SRX6989872](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX6989872?show=reads)) using FALCON [Chin et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4035) and the HiRise pipeline [Putnam et al., 2016](http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.193474.115) by [Dovetail Genomics](https://dovetailgenomics.com). Illumina short reads of strain PX506 have been used ([SRX6989866](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX6989866?show=reads), [SRX6989867](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX6989867?show=reads); University of Oregon Sequencing Facility, Eugene, OR; [PRJNA577507](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA577507?show=reads)) to verify the genome assembly and the addition of the mitochondrial genome.
