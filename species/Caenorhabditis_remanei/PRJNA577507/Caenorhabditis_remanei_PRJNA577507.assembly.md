This is a chromosome-level genome assembly of the _C. remanei_ PX506 inbred strain created from a wild isolate from an isopod collected in a forest near Toronto (Canada). The primary contigs were generated from two PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) Cells using the FALCON assembler and the final scaffolds were constructed with Dovetail Genomics Hi-C library sequences and the HiRise software pipeline, as described by [Teterina et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32111628/).
