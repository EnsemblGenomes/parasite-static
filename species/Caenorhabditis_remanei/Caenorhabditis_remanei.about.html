<i>Caenorhabditis remanei</i> is a small, free-living roundworm found in decaying plant material especially compost, mushroom beds in Northern temperate regions. The worms feed on the bacteria and other micro-organisms associated with plant decay. The biology of <i>C. remanei</i> is similar to that of <i>C. elegans</i>, with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. <i>C.remanei</i> has both male and female adults unlike the hermaphroditic species such as <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i>. All three species are often found at the same site. <i>C. remanei</i> is frequently found associated with snails, slugs, millipedes, mites and pill bugs, which are presumed to transport worms, especially the dormant dauer stage, from one location to another, as with other Caenorhabditids.
