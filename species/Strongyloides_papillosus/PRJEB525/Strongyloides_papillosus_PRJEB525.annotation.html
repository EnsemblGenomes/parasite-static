The gene predictions were made by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753">Hunt et al. (2016)</a>. An in-house automatic pipeline (based around <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15215400">AUGUSTUS</a> plus <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575">MAKER</a>) was used to generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of targeted manual curation of selected gene families.
