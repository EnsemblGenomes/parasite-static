The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with Adrian Streit (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology) as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project, followed by some bespoke manual improvement, including the use of genetic markers described by [Nemetschke et al, 2010](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20832309/) (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, [Hunt et al. (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753)).
