_Caenorhabditis tribulationis_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 40_) was formally described by [Stevens et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. Molecular data suggest its closest known relatives to be _C. sinica_ and _C. zanzibari_. It reproduces through males and females. The species type isolate was collected from humus sampled below a cathedral fig tree in Queensland, Australia in 2014.
