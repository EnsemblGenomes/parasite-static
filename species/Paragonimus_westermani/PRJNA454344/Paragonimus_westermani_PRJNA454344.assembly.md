Short-insert Illumina reads were assembled using ABYSS, with scaffolding guided by PacBio reads. Mate-pair libraries were used for further scaffolding (with SSPACE). SoapDenovo2 GapCloser was used for gap filling. The assembly is described in full by [Oey et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30520948/).
