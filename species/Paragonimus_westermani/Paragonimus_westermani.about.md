The lung fluke _Paragonimus westermani_ is found in Southeast Asia and Japan, and is the most common cause of paragonimiasis. Infection is characterised by chronic inflammatory lung disease, though in severe cases the parasite can also infect the brain and CNS. _P. westermani_ has two intermediate hosts: freshwater snails and crustaceans. The definitive host (such as humans) is infected upon ingestion of undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish.
