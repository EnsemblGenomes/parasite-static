The genome was annotated using the [MAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280279/) pipeline v2.31.8. Ab initio gene predictions from [BRAKER v2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787252/) and [AUGUSTUS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078167/) v3.2.2 (trained by BRAKER and run within MAKER) were refined using transcript and protein evidence. To reduce false-positives, gene predictions without supporting evidence were excluded, with the exception of those encoding Pfam domains, as detected by [InterProScan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998142/) v5.19. Gene products were named using [PANNZER2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25653249/) and [sma3s](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.201700071) v2. The annotation is described in full in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/).
