Illumina reads were assembled using [Allpaths_LG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029755/). Scaffolding was improved using an in-house tool called Pygap, the Pyramid assembler with Illumina paired reads to close gaps and extend contigs, and [L_RNA_scaffolder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846640/), which uses transcript alignments to improve contiguity. The assembly process is described in full in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/).
