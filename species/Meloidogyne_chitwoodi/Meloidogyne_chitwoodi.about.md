_Meloidogyne chitwoodi_, commonly known as the Columbia root-knot nematode (CRKN), is an important soilborne, sedentary endoparasite of potato. It is one of the most devastating pests of potato in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Nematode-infected tubers develop external as well as internal defects, making the potato tubers unmarketable, and resulting in economic losses.
