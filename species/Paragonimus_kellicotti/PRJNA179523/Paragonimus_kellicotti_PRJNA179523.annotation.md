The full annotation process is described in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/). The genome was annotated using the MAKER pipeline v2.31.8. Ab initio gene predictions from BRAKER v2 and AUGUSTUS v3.2.2 (trained by BRAKER and run within MAKER) were refined using transcript and protein evidence. To reduce false-positives, gene predictions without supporting evidence were excluded, with the exception of those encoding Pfam domains, as detected by InterProScan v5.19. Gene products were named using PANNZER2 and sma3s v2.
