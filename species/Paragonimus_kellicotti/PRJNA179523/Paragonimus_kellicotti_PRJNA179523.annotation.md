The full annotation process is outlined in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/).
The nuclear genome was annotated using the [MAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280279/) pipeline v2.31.8. RNA-seq reads were aligned to their respective genome assemblies and assembled using [StringTie](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643835/) v1.2.4. Ab initio gene predictions from [BRAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078167/) v2 and AUGUSTUS v3.2.2 (trained by BRAKER and run within MAKER) were refined using transcript and protein evidence.
