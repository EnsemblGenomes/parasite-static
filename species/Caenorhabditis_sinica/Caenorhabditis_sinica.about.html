<i>Caenorhabditis sinica</i> belongs to the <i>Elegans</i> group in the genus <i>Caenorhabditis</i>, being phylogenetically close to <i>C. briggsae</i> although differing in reproductive mode. The gonochoristic <i>C. sinica</i> displays two significantly larger distal parts of uteri filled with sperms in the female/hermaphroditic gonad than does the androdioecious <i>C. briggsae</i>. <i>C. sinica</i> can be differentiated morphologically from all known <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species within the <i>Elegans</i> group by presenting a uniquely shaped, three-pointed hook structure on the male precloacal lip. <i>C. sinica</i> is found frequently in China.
