_Caenorhabditis sinica_ belongs to the _Elegans_ group in the genus _Caenorhabditis_, being phylogenetically close to _C. briggsae_ although differing in reproductive mode. The gonochoristic _C. sinica_ displays two significantly larger distal parts of uteri filled with sperms in the female/hermaphroditic gonad than does the androdioecious _C. briggsae_. _C. sinica_ can be differentiated morphologically from all known _Caenorhabditis_ species within the _Elegans_ group by presenting a uniquely shaped, three-pointed hook structure on the male precloacal lip. _C. sinica_ is found frequently in China.
