_Plectus sambesii_ is a free-living species of nematode, studied in context of its embryonic development. Unusually, cell specification is not correlated with cell lineage but with their position in the body. With this peculiarity, _P. sambesii_ appears to occupy an intermediate position between basal nematodes displaying a variable early development and the _C. elegans_-like invariant pattern.
