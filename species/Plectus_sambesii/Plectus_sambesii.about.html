<i>Plectus sambesii</i> is a free-living marine species of nematode, studied in context of its embryonic development. Unusually, cell specification is not correlated with cell lineage but with their position in the body. With this peculiarity, <i>P. sambesii</i> appears to occupy an intermediate position between basal nematodes displaying a variable early development and the <i>C. elegans</i>-like invariant pattern.
