This genome was produced by the [Gasser laboratory at the University of Melbourne](http://www.gasserlab.org/), as part of the assembly and analysis of all 12 recognized _Trichinella_ species (described in [Korhonen et al (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26830005)). This strain, ISS588, had a brown rat from Russia as its original host.
