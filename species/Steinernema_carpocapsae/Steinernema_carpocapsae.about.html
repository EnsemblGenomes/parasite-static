<i>Steinernema carpocapsae</i> is a parasitic nematode capable of infecting a broad range of insect species. The infective juvenile, which emerges from a depleted host cadaver to seek out a new insect to infect, is the only free-living stage. Infective juveniles tend to be found at the soil surface, and use an ambushing search strategy in which they stand on their tails and attach to a passing insect.
