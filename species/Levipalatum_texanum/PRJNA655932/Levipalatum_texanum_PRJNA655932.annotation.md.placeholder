The full annotations process is described in full in [ et al.,()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7826178/). The genome was annotated using the BRAKER pipeline. The BAM file created by aligning RNA-Seq reads to the genome with STAR was included in this process. The mitochondrial genomes were annotated using MITOS2 on the MITOS Web Server
