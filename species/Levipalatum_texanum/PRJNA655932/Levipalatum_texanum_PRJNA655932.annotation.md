The full annotation process is outlined in [Casasa et al., (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7826178/). The genome was annotated using the [BRAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635606/) pipeline. The BAM file created by aligning RNA-Seq reads to the genome with [STAR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530905/) was included in this process. The mitochondrial genomes were annotated using MITOS2 on the [MITOS Web Server](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790312003326?via%3Dihub).
