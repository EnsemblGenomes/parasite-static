The assembly presented here is derived from _E. oligarthrus_ protoscoleces collected from cysts of naturally infected agoutis in Iguaz√∫ National Park, Argentina. Decontaminated Illumina reads were assembled using SPAdes and scaffolded with Chromosomer, as described by [Moldanado et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31440275/). This assembly is a scaffolded version of the contigs in [GCA_900683695.1](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_900683695.1).
