This genome was submitted to ENA on July 6, 2023 by [LBMC UMR5239](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LBMC) and has been imported from there. Mixed _M. spiculigera_ developmental stages have been pooled and sequenced using both short- (Illumina HiSeq 4000) and long-read sequencing technology. The reads were polished and assembled using [Canu](https://canu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html), [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [Quickmerge](https://github.com/mahulchak/quickmerge), [Pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon) and [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka).
