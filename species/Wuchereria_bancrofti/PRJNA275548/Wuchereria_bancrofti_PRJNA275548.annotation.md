Homology-based gene predictions were generated in [GeMoMa](https://www.jstacs.de/index.php/GeMoMa) using [B. malayi gene models (PRJNA10729)](https://wormbase.org/species/b_malayi). These predictions were supplemented with ab initio gene predictions from [BRAKER2](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER), trained using B. malayi, which were refined based on transcript and protein homology evidence from related filarial worm species in [MAKER](https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/maker). The annotation has been generated and provided by the [Mitreva Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/mitrevalab) at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis ](https://medicine.wustl.edu/).
