Pac Bio sequencing using chemistry RS II was performed on DNA isolated from the _Wuchereria bancrofti_ samples described in [Small et al 2016](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26850696). Ten PacBio SMRT cells were run for an estimated coverage of 20-40X. Whole genomes were aligned using [progressiveCactus](https://github.com/glennhickey/progressiveCactus) with a guide tree reconstructed from whole mitochondrial genomes [Small et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4257870/)‚Å†. [Ragout](https://github.com/fenderglass/Ragout) [Kolmogorov et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931998/) was run allowing for repeat resolution with scaffolds named according to _B. malayi_ reference genome.

This is an update to the older [GCA_001555675.1](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_001555675.1) _W. bancrofti_ genome by [Small et al 2016](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26850696).
