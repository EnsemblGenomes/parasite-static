The original gene predictions were made by the [Chinese National Human Genome Center](http://chgc.sh.cn/en/), and published in [2009](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19606140). The gene models have subsequently been improved, and the version represented here is the December 2013 snapshot from [GeneDB](http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Sjaponicum).
