The original gene predictions were made by the <a href="http://chgc.sh.cn/en/">Chinese National Human Genome Center</a>, and published in <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19606140">2009</a>. The gene models have subsequently been improved, and the version represented here is the December 2013 snapshot from <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Sjaponicum">GeneDB</a>.
