The trematode _Schistosoma japonicum_, or Asian blood fluke, is a parasite of significant public health importance in China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Southeast Asia. _S.Â japonicum_ is one of the three major infectious agents responsible for the chronic debilitating disease schistosomiasis. The intermediate host for the parasite is snail and the definitive host a wide range of at least 31 species of wild mammals, therefore it can be considered a true zoonosis. Burdens of morbidity are high and schistosomiasis may contribute to several hundred thousand human deaths annually.
