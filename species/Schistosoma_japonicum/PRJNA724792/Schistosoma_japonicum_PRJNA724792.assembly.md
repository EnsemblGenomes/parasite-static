The full assembly process is described in [Xu et al., (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13689).

Scaffolding using [bowtie 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248320/) version 2.3.3.1. All raw reads obtained by PacBio sequencing were aligned to each other using daligner, executed using the falcon (version 0.7) assembler (Chin et al., 2016). Overlapping reads and raw subreads were processed to produce consensus sequences.
