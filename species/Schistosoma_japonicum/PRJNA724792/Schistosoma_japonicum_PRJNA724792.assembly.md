The full assembly process is described in [Xu et al., (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13689). Scaffolding was conducted using [bowtie 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322381/) version 2.3.3.1. Raw PacBio reads were aligned to each other using daligner, executed using the [falcon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5503144/) (version 0.7) assembler. Overlapping reads and raw subreads were processed to produce consensus sequences.
