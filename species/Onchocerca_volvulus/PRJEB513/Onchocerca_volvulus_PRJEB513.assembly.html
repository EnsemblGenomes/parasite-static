The reference genome for <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> has been produced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with Sara Lustigman (New York Blood Center). A combination of deep sequencing and optical mapping was used on material from a single adult worm from the Republic of Cameroon.
