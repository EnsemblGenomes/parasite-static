Paired-end reads between 150- and 500-bp in length were trimmed using Cutadapt and error corrected with Reckoner. To check insert size, a preliminary single-end assembly was created with Minia. SPAdes was then used to fully assemble the nuclear genome, and scaffolds that were identified as contamination, at low coverage (<1×), and < 500 bp in length were removed. PlasmidSPAdes was used to assemble the mitochondrial genome.
