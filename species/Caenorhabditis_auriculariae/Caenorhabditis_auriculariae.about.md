_Caenorhabditis auriculariae_ is a free-living, rare, neglected species which was reported only once in 1999 as an associate of the fruiting bodies of the basidiomycota fungus _Auricularia polytricha_. The species has a short stoma, bifurcated metastegostomatal teeth, a spicule structure similar to the drosophilae super group, and closed bursa similar to several species in the drosophilae and elegans super group species. _C. auriculariae_ is phylogenetically placed at the basal position of the genus.
