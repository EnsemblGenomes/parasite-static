One of the <i>Trichinella</i> genus of parasitic nematodes, the causative agents of trichinosis (also known as trichinellosis). The unnamed genotype <i>Trichinella</i> T8 is closely related to <i>T. britovi</i> and has been detected only three times in sylvatic carnivores (lions and a spotted hyena) and only in South Africa and Namibia.
