The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with Mark Eberhard (CDC, USA) as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. The assembly uses Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction.
