The nematode _Dracunculus medinensis_ causes dracunculiasis, or Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) in remote areas of Africa without access to safe drinking water. Humans acquire the parasite when they drink water containing copepods infected with _D.Â medinensis_ larvae. Nearly eradicated as a result of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme, which reduced 3.5 million cases in 1986 to 148 cases in 2013, GWD has reemerged in Chad in 2010 after an absence of 2 years.
