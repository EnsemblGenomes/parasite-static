As described by [Shahid Siddique et al., (2022)](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/36261416), the gene predictions were made by [The H. schachtii genome sequencing consortium](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/research/sebastianevesvandenakker). An in-house pipeline was developed to generate gene models using [Braker2](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa108) supplied with RNAseq data.
