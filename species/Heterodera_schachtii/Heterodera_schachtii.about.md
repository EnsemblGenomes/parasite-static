_Heterodera schachtii_, also known as the beet cyst nematode or sugarbeet nematode, is a plant pathogenic parasite which can infect more than 200 plants including the model plant _Arabidopsis thaliana_. _H. schachtii_ is an important agricultural pest on sugar beet and brassicaceous crops in its own right and is closely related to the soybean cyst nematode, [_H. glycines_](https://parasite.wormbase.org/Heterodera_glycines_prjna381081/Info/SpeciesLanding), which is one of the severely economically damaging plant-parasitic nematodes worldwide.
