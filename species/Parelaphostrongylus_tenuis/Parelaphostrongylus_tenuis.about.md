_Parelaphostrongylus tenuis,_ also known as brainworm, is a neurotropic parasite commonly found in white-tailed deer, damaging their central nervous system. It infects other species like moose, elk, and caribou when their habitats overlap with high densities of white-tailed deer, leading to neurological instead of meningeal tissue infections.
