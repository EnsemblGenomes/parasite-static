_Caenorhabditis becei_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 29_) was formally described by [Stevens et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. It is a member of the Japonica group in the _Caenorhabditis_ genus; molecular data suggest its closest known relatives to be _C. nouraguensis_, _C. yunquensis_, _C. macrosperma_, _C. waitukubuli_, and _C. panamensis_. It reproduces through males and females. The species type isolate was collected from a rotting flower on Barro Colorado Island, Panama in 2012.
