The reference genome was assembled by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with Mark Viney (University of Bristol), using a combination of capillary, 454 and Illumina paired-end sequence and [genetic map](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19887089/) data, and improved using bespoke manual and automated tools (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, [Hunt et al. (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753)).
