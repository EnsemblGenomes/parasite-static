The reference genome was assembled by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with Mark Viney (University of Bristol), using a combination of capillary, 454 and Illumina paired-end sequence and <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19887089/">genetic map</a> data, and improved using bespoke manual and automated tools (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753">Hunt et al. (2016)</a>).
