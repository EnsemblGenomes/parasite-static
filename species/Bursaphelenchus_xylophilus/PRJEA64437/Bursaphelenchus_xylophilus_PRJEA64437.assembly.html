The<em> B.&nbsp;xylophilus</em> genome has been sequenced by a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.ffpri.affrc.go.jp/en/">Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute</a>, and the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, as described in <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21909270">Kikuchi et all (2011)</a>. The assembly version represented here was submitted directly to WormBase by Taisei Kikuchi in 2011, and is a slightly improved version of that deposited in INSDC (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000231135.1)">GCA_000231135.1</a>).
