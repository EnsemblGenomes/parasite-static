The_ B.Â xylophilus_ genome has been sequenced by a collaboration between the [Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute](http://www.ffpri.affrc.go.jp/en/), and the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), as described in [Kikuchi et all (2011)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21909270). The assembly version represented here was submitted directly to WormBase by Taisei Kikuchi in 2011, and is a slightly improved version of that deposited in INSDC ([GCA_000231135.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000231135.1))).
