The nematode _Onchocerca ochengi_ is a filarial parasite of cattle, and is native to West Africa, including Cameroon. _O. ochengi_ is very closely related to the human-parasitic _Onchocerca volvulus_, the tractability of the bovine host makes the _O. ochengi_-cattle model a useful one in vaccine and drug development work forÂ _Onchocerca_.
