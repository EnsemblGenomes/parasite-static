This genome assembly was provided by Duncan Berger. It was generated from 1 Female adult worm, sampled in Zambia (2002). [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing and Hi-C chromosome conformation capture technologies were used. [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).

From release 18, the older [GCA_900618395.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_900618395.1) genome has been replaced by this one.
