Putative gene models from the annotation accompanying previous assembly ASM23792v2 ( <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936" > Protasio et al 2012 </a>)  and predictions using RNASeq data were resolved through manual curation over the course of several months, using <a href="http://genomearchitect.github.io/">Apollo</a> as a platform. For unchanged gene models, previous gene identifiers have been preserved. Manuscript in preparation.
