Putative gene models from the annotation accompanying previous assembly ASM23792v2 ( [ Protasio et al 2012 ](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936))  and predictions using RNASeq data were resolved through manual curation over the course of several months, using [Apollo](http://genomearchitect.github.io/) as a platform. For unchanged gene models, previous gene identifiers have been preserved. Manuscript in preparation.
