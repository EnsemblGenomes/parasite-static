The reads from a variety of short and long-range paired end capillary libraries and short-range Illumina paired end libraries were mapped to assembly accession ASM23792v2 ( <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936" > Protasio et al 2012 </a>) and these mapped reads were manually scrutinised in GAP5 and edits to the assembly were made as necessary.  Further direction for assembly improvement came from inspection of optical map alignments, and the result was an intermediate improved assembly.  This assembly was further improved following assimilation of PacBio data to create a highly complete and very accurate chromosome scale assembly. Manuscript in preparation.
