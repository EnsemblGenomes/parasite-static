The reads from short and long-range paired end capillary libraries and short-range Illumina paired end libraries were mapped to assembly accession GCA_000237925.2 ([Protasio et al 2012](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936); version 5.2). Mapped reads were scrutinised in GAP5 and manual edits to the assembly were made as necessary. After inspection of optical map alignments and integration of PacBio reads, version 7 was produced (GCA_000237925.3; unpublished). Following incorporation of HiC data, and further PacBio analysis to resolve repeats a near-complete chromosomal assembly v9 is now available (GCA_000237925.5; unpublished) and presented here. More information can be found in this pre-print by [Buddenborg et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.456314).
