The reads from short and long-range paired end capillary libraries and short-range Illumina paired end libraries were mapped to assembly accession GCA_000237925.2 ([Protasio et al 2012](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936); version 5.2). Mapped reads were scrutinised in GAP5 and manual edits to the assembly were made as necessary. Inspection of optical map alignments and integration of PacBio reads led to version 7 (GCA_000237925.3). Here we're presenting an updated assembly which has been further improved following assimilation of Oxford Nanopore, PacBio, and HiC data to create a complete telomere-to-telomere chromosome scale assembly (GCA_000237925.5).
