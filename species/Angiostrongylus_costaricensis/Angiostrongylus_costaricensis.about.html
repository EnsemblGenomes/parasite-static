The nematode <em>Angiostrongylus&nbsp;costaricensis</em> is the causal agent of abdominal, or intestinal, angiostrongyliasis. Humans are incidental hosts that become infected through ingestion of raw or undercooked infected rats (definitive host) snails, slugs, crabs, freshwater shrimps, or vegetables contaminated by slime from or parts of infected snails and slugs.
