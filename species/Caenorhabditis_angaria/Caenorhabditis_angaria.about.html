<i>Caenorhabditis angaria</i> is associated with the palm and sugarcane weevils, <i>Rhynchophorus palmarum</i> and <i>Metamasius hemipterus (Curculionidae)</i> in Trinidad and Florida. The nematodes propagate on decomposing tissue of coconut palms and sugar cane in the galleries of the weevils. Dauer larvae wave and are transported by adult weevils. The association is probably phoretic, although <i>C. angaria</i> can develop on dead weevils.
