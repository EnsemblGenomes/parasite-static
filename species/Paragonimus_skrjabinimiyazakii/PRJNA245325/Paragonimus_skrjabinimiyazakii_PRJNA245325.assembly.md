The full assembly process is outlined in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/). Sequences were generated on the Illumina platform and assembled using Allpaths_LG. Pygap (gap closure tool) was used to improve scaffolding. L_RNA_scaffolder which uses transcript alignments to improve contiguity was also used.
