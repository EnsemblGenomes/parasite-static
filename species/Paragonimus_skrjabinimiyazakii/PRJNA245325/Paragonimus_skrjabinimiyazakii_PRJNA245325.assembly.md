The full assembly process is outlined in [Rosa et al., (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/). Sequences were generated on the Illumina platform and assembled using [Allpaths_LG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029755/). An in-house tool, Pygap, was used to improve scaffolding. [L_RNA_scaffolder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846640/) which uses transcript alignments to improve contiguity was also used.
