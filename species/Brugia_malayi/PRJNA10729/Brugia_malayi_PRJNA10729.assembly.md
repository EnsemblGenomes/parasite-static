The _B.malayi_ genome was first sequenced at the former [TIGR institute](http://www.jcvi.org/) and described by [Ghedin et al (2007)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17885136). In 2012 a new genome sequencing, assembly and curation project was conducted on the FR3 strain as a cooperative effort between [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/) and the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu/). An improvement of this assembly by including [PacBio](http://www.pacb.com/) and optical mapping data was conducted in 2016, allowing the scaffolding of chromosomes as well as better representation of repetitive regions. This sequenced FR3 strain is available at the [Filiarisis Research Reagent Center](http://www.filariasiscenter.org/).

 A publication covering the new assembly is in progress, and the consortium reserves itself the right of first publication.
