The <em>B.malayi</em> genome was first sequenced at the former <a href="http://www.jcvi.org/">TIGR institute</a> and described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17885136">Ghedin et al (2007)</a>. In 2012 a new genome sequencing, assembly and curation project was conducted on the FR3 strain as a cooperative effort between <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/">WormBase</a> and the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>. An improvement of this assembly by including <a href="http://www.pacb.com/">PacBio</a> and optical mapping data was conducted in 2016, allowing the scaffolding of chromosomes as well as better representation of repetitive regions. This sequenced FR3 strain is available at the <a href="http://www.filariasiscenter.org/">Filiarisis Research Reagent Center</a>.<br> A publication covering the new assembly is in progress, and the consortium reserves itself the right of first publication.
