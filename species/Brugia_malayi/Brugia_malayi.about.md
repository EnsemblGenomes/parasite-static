The nematode _Brugia malayi_ is a gonochoristic (male-female) filarial parasite, of medical interest because it infects mosquito vectors (_Aedes_, _Anopheles_ and _Culex_) and humans, and is phylogenetically representative of other infectious nematodes. Infection of humans by _B. malayi_ causes filariasis, also known as elephantiasis. _B.Â malayi_ is readily infective in laboratory animals.
