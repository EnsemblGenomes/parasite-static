The nematode <em>Brugia malayi</em> is a gonochoristic (male-female) filarial parasite, of medical interest because it infects mosquito vectors (<em>Aedes</em>, <em>Anopheles</em> and <em>Culex</em>) and humans, and is phylogenetically representative of other infectious nematodes. Infection of humans by <em>B. malayi</em> causes filariasis, also known as elephantiasis. <em>B.&nbsp;malayi</em> is readily infective in laboratory animals.
