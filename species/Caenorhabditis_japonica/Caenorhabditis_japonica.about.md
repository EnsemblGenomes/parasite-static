_Caenorhabditis japonica_ is a small, free-living roundworm which appears to be closely-associated with shield, or stink, bugs. Frequently, these insects can be found on cabbage plants and the worms have been reported feeding in the bug's nest on dead eggs and adult bugs. _C. japonica_ has only been isolated on the Japanese islands of Saga and Shikoku. The biology of _C. japonica_ is similar to that of _C. elegans_ with the exception that _C. japonica_ has both male and female adults.
