<i>Caenorhabditis japonica</i> is a small, free-living roundworm which appears to be closely-associated with shield, or stink, bugs. Frequently, these insects can be found on cabbage plants and the worms have been reported feeding in the bug's nest on dead eggs and adult bugs. <i>C. japonica</i> has only been isolated on the Japanese islands of Saga and Shikoku. The biology of <i>C. japonica</i> is similar to that of <i>C. elegans</i> with the exception that <i>C. japonica</i> has both male and female adults.
