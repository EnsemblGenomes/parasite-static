The trematode <i>Schistosoma bovis</i> is a parasite of sheep, cattle and goats in North Africa, Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East. It exists in the same geographical areas as <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i>, with which it can hybridise. <i>S. bovis-S. haematobium</i> hybrids can infect humans, and have been reported in West African countries, namely Senegal, and during a 2013 outbreak on Corsica.
