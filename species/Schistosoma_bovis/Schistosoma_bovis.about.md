The trematode _Schistosoma bovis_ is a parasite of sheep, cattle and goats in North Africa, Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East. It exists in the same geographical areas as _Schistosoma haematobium_, with which it can hybridise. _S. bovis_-_S. haematobium_ hybrids can infect humans, and have been reported in West African countries, namely Senegal, and during a 2013 outbreak on Corsica.
