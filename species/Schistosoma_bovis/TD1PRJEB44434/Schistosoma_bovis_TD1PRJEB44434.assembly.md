This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data, scaffolded using and Hi-C. The source material for genome sequencing was 30 single-miracidium-derived female adult worms, originally obtained from Spain in 2019, and provided by Christoph Grunau, Jerome Boissier, and Helene Mone from the [University of Perpignan](https://www.univ-perp.fr/en). Additional worms from the same collection were used for gene finding.
