The nematode _Toxocara canis_, or dog roundworm, is a worldwide-distributed intestinal parasite of dogs and other canids, and is thought to be the most common parasite infection of humans in the United States of America. It has a wide host range. Humans are infected by accidental ingestion of infective eggs from dog faeces, causing toxocariasis, an infection of organs such as the liver, lungs, eyes or brain. _T.Â canis_ has many characteristics that make it a useful model system.
