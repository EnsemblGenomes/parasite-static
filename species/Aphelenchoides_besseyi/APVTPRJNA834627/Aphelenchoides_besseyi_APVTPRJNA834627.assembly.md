For this assembly, the _Aphelenchoides pseudobesseyi_ VT strain was used, which was collected from the rice field of Linnei, Nantou and Hiroshima, Japan.
  
According to [Lai, C.-K., et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13752), raw Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing reads were assembled using the [flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) (version 2.8.2) assembler. The assembly was corrected using [racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon) (version 1.4.6) and [medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) version 0.10.0. The assembly was further corrected using Illumina reads using [pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon) (version 1.22) with five iterations. The genome was reference-scaffolded based on this assembly using [ragtag](https://github.com/malonge/RagTag).
