_Caenorhabditis bovis_ is unusual among the _Caenorhabditis genus_ in being commonly associated with a vertebrate, the species having been isolated several times from the outer auditory canal of Zebu cattle in Eastern Africa. It has been associated with bovine parasitic otitis, though whether _C. bovis_ causes the disease directly remains unclear. _C. bovis_ is also believed to have a phoretic association with the larval stages of the Old World screwworm fly (_Chrysomya bezziana_), which is itself found in the ears of Zebu cattle.
