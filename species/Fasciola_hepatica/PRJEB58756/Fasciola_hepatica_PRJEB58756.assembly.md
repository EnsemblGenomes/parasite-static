This genome assembly originates from the sensitive Adult fluke S strain of _Fasciola hepatica_, sequenced using PacBio technology. The assembly process employed the Hifi/hifiasm method with additional HiC scaffolding. This genome was provided by [Prof. Steve Patterson](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/infection-veterinary-and-ecological-sciences/staff/stephen-paterson/), [Centre for Genomic Research and NERC Environmental Omics Facility](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/genomic-research/), Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/).

This improved genome has replaced the older [PRJEB25283](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB25283) - [GCA_900302435.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_900302435.1) from the same group, in release 19.
