The gene predictions were made by the [Mitreva laboratory of the Division of Infectious Diseases at theWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/makedonka-mitreva/). Protein coding genes were predicted from the masked assembly using a combination of [Snap](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-5-59), [Fgenesh](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10779491/), [Augustus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16845043/), and the [MAKER annotation pipeline](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18025269/) using evidence from assembled transcripts, ESTs (GenBank EST database), and protein sequences from _F. hepatica_ and related organisms.
