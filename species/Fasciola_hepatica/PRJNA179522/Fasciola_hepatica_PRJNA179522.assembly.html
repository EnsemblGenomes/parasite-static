The genome assembly was produced by the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/">Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University</a>, and submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.\n\nIt is similar, but not exactly equivalent to, the assembly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_002763495.1" >GCA_002763495.1</a>, containing 133 additional scaffolds.
