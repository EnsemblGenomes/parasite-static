The genome assembly was produced by the [Mitreva laboratory of the Division of Infectious Diseases at theWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/makedonka-mitreva/). The first version of this assembly submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. The version presented here is an improved version of the assembly (GCA_002763495.2) submitted in 2019. The assembly uses Illumina HiSeq2000 paired-end sequencing. [ALLPATHS-LG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029755) was used to assemble the Illumina reads. Pygap, an in-house assembly improvement tool, was used to join and extend contigs using unassembled reads when possible.
