The genome assembly was produced by the [Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/), and submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.\n\nIt is similar, but not exactly equivalent to, the assembly [GCA_002763495.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_002763495.1), containing 133 additional scaffolds.
