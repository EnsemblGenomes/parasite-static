Dicrocoelium dendriticum is one of the parasite species responsible for Dicrocoeliosis, an important hepatic parasitosis in ruminants. The parasite ives in the bile duct and gall bladder of various species of mammal, mainly ruminants, and occasionally affects humans. Different species of land mollusc and ant, which act as primary and secondary intermediate hosts, respectively, and mammals intervene in the life cycle of this Digenea. Its complex parasite transmission makes it very difficult to apply prophylactic and control measures. From [Mart√≠nez-Ibeas A.M. et al., (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.010).
