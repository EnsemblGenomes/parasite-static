This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C.
  
The source material for genome sequencing was five adult worms, obtained from Iran in 2019, provided by Elham Moghaddas from [Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran](http://www.mums.ac.ir/).
