_Caenorhabditis parvicauda_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 21_) was formally described by [Stevens et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. It reproduces through males and females. _C. parvicauda_ is notable for unusual morphological novelty compared with other known members of the genus. The species type isolate was collected from a rotting fruit collected on the island of Sainte-Marie, Madagascar in 2010.
