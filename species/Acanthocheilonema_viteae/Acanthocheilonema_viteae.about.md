The nematode _Acanthocheilonema viteae_ is a filarial parasite of rodents. It is widely used as a model for human filariases. Importantly, _A.Â viteae_ lacks the Wolbachia bacterial endosymbiont found in most human-infective filarial nematodes. Thus this species has become central in efforts to understand the role of the Wolbachia in the nematode-bacterial symbiosis, and in particular its possible role in immune evasion.
