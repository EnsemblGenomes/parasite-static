The nematode _Soboliphyme baturini_ is a stomach- or intestinal-dwelling parasite mainly of Holarctic mustelids (_Martes_ andÂ _Mustela_) and is included in the 50HG project as a comparator  the first representative of this order for which specimens could be obtained. Larvae develop in oligochaete (earthworms) and it is thought the life cycle involves only two hosts. Members of this genus and family are also found in insectivores and shrews.
