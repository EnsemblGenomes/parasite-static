_Setaria digitata_ is a filarial nematode found in the peritoneal cavity of ungulates. Whilst generally nonpathogenic in this environment, the worms can migrate to the nervous system or the eyes, where they cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis. _S. digitata_ is found in Asia, where it is vectored by various species of mosquito. Due to its similarity to _Wuchereria bancrofti_, it has been used as a model for lymphatic filariasis.
