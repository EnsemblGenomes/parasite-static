The gene models were made by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> using an automated prediction tool <a href="http://exon.gatech.edu/braker1.html">BRAKER1</a> to generate preliminary gene models, which were subsequently improved using IsoSeq, incorporating orthologs using <a href="https://github.com/PASApipeline/PASApipeline/wiki">PASA</a> and <a href="https://evidencemodeler.github.io/">EVidenceModeler</a>, and submitted to WormBase in summer 2018.
