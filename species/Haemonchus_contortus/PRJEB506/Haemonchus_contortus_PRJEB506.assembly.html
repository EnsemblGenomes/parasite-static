The assembly presented here has been sequenced at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>. The previous reference genome (<a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23985316">Laing et al. (2013)</a>) was improved through additional sequencing with long PacBio reads and optical mapping, giving a chromosome-level assembly. Manuscript in preparation.
