The gene models were made by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) using an automated prediction tool [BRAKER1](http://exon.gatech.edu/braker1.html) to generate preliminary gene models, which were subsequently improved using IsoSeq, incorporating orthologs using [PASA](https://github.com/PASApipeline/PASApipeline/wiki) and [EVidenceModeler](https://evidencemodeler.github.io/), and submitted to WormBase in summer 2018.
