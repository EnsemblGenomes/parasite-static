The assembly presented here has been sequenced at the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/). The previous reference genome ([Laing et al. (2013)](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23985316)) was improved through additional sequencing with long PacBio reads and optical mapping, giving a chromosome-level assembly. Manuscript in preparation.
