The _H.Â contortus_ genome was sequenced by the [Gasser laboratory at the University of Melbourne](http://www.gasserlab.org/), as described by [Schwarz et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23985341). The version of the genome represented here is that submitted directly to WormBase in 2013, which is similar to, but not exactly the same as, NCBI assembly [GCA_000442195.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000442195.1), containing 31 additional scaffolds.
