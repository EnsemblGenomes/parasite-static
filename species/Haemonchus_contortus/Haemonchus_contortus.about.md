The nematode _Haemonchus contortus_, or red stomach worm, wire worm or Barber's pole worm, is an animal endoparasite infecting wild and domesticated ruminants (including sheep and goats) worldwide. It is a very common parasite and one the most pathogenic nematodes of ruminants. Adult worms are attached to abomasal mucosa and feed on the blood. _H.Â contortus_ is a close relative of the human hookworm species which makes it an important model of parasitic nematode biology that is commonly used for experimental studies.
