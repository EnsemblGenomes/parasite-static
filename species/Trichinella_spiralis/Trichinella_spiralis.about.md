The nematode _TrichinellaÂ spiralis_ is a roundworm with an unsegmented body that is a parasite of swine. Trichinosis is a disease of swine that can pass to humans by the eating of undercooked pork, digestive juices from the stomach dissolve the capsule-like cyst and release the parasites. The larvae then penetrate into the intestine where they mature and mate.
