*Schistosoma turkestanicum* is a parasitic blood fluke that infects domestic and wild ruminants, including sheep, goats, and cattle. This species is primarily found in the Middle East, Central Asia and Europe particularly in Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Hungary. *S. turkestanicum* has a complex life cycle, involving freshwater snails as intermediate hosts and mammalian hosts as definitive hosts. In many countries of Asia, cercarial dermatitis (CD) caused by *S. turkestanicum* is considered to be an emerging public health problem especially for people who work in water-covered lands. Cercarial dermatitis caused by the larvae of *S. turkestanicum* has also been detected in Hungary.
