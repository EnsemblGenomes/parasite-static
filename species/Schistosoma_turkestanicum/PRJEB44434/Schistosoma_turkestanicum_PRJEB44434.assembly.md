This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C.
  
The source material for genome sequencing was three adult male worms, originally obtained from Hungary, provided by Alexandra Juhaz and Gabor Majoros ([University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest](https://www.vethungary.com/)), and Scott Lawton (SRUC) and Milly Eldridge ([Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/)). Additional worms from the same collection were used for gene finding.
