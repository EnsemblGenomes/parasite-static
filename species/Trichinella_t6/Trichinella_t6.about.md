One of the _Trichinella_ genus of parasitic nematodes, the causative agents of trichinosis (also known as trichinellosis). The unnamed genotype _Trichinella_ T6 is closely related to _T. nativa_ and has been detected in several regions of Canada (British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba) and the United States (Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Pennsylvania). Natural hybrids between _Trichinella_ T6 and _T. nativa_ have been detected in nature, suggesting a recent separation between the two taxa.
