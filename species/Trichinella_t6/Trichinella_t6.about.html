One of the <i>Trichinella</i> genus of parasitic nematodes, the causative agents of trichinosis (also known as trichinellosis). The unnamed genotype <i>Trichinella</i> T6 is closely related to <i>T. nativa</i> and has been detected in several regions of Canada (British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba) and the United States (Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Pennsylvania). Natural hybrids between <i>Trichinella</i> T6 and <i>T. nativa</i> have been detected in nature, suggesting a recent separation between the two taxa.
