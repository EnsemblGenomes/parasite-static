The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Institute of Parasitology](https://www.paras.uzh.ch/en.html) of the [Vetsuisse-Faculty](https://www.vet.uzh.ch/en.html) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). The assembly uses GridION X5 Oxford Nanopore sequencing followed by further polishing with Illumina RNA-seq short reads (Novaseq 6000 pair end at 2 × 150 bp) using 4 rounds of Pilon v1.23 with – fix all parameter.
