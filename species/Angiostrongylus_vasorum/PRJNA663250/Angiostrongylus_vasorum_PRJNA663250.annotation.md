The gene predictions were made by the [Institute of Parasitology](https://www.paras.uzh.ch/en.html) of the [Vetsuisse-Faculty](https://www.vet.uzh.ch/en.html) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). A custom repeat library along with the Dfam (3.0) database of repetitive DNA families was used for masking on the draft genome using RepeatMasker v4.0.9. An in-house pipeline was developed that used [MAKER](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575) to generate high-quality annotations by integrating evidence from multiple sources: ab initio gene predictions from [AUGUSTUS](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16845043), [SNAP](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15144565) and mRNAs and proteins from related organisms.
