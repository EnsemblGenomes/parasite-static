_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a species of parasitic nematode in the family _Metastrongylidae_. It is a clinically important parasitic member of the _Angiostrongylus_ genus as it lives in the pulmonary arteries and the right side of the heart of several canid species, including domestic dogs (_Canis familiaris_) and red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_), causing canine angiostrongylosis.
