<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments. In 1963, Sydney Brenner proposed research into <i>C. elegans</i> primarily in the area of neuronal development. In 1974, he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of <i>C. elegans</i>, which has since been extensively used as a model organism. <i>C. elegans</i> was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced, and as of 2012, the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal "wiring diagram") completed.
