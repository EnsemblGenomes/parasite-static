_Caenorhabditis elegans_ is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments. In 1963, Sydney Brenner proposed research into _C. elegans_ primarily in the area of neuronal development. In 1974, he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of _C. elegans_, which has since been extensively used as a model organism. _C. elegans_ was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced, and as of 2012, the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal "wiring diagram") completed.
