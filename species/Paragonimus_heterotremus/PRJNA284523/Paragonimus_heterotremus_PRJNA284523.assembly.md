Full assembly methods are outlined in [Rosa., et al (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370270/). Illumina reads were assembled using Allpaths_LG. Scaffolding was improved using Pygap (gap closure tool), the Pyramid assembler with Illumina paired reads to close gaps and extend contigs, and L_RNA_scaffolder, which uses transcript alignments to improve contiguity.
