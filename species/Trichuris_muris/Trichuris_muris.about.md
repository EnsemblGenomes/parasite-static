The nematode _TrichurisÂ muris_, or murine whipworm, is a gastrointestinal parasite of mice which resides in the caecum and colon and has a direct oral faecal life cycle. It is a remarkably tractable model system for dissecting immune responses and host parasite relationships and is actively being investigated in a number of laboratories worldwide.
