The draft genome assembly was produced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with Dee Denver (Oregon State University), using Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753">Hunt et al. (2016)</a>).
