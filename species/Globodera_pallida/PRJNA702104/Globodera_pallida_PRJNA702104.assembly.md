A genome assembly pipeline was used to generate a high-quality assembly from long sequencing reads. [Canu](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28298431/) was used for error correction, followed by assembly with [wtdbg2](https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2). The assembly was assessed for contamination using [BlobTools](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1287/v1). A BLASTn approach was followed to further decontaminate the assembly. Contaminant contigs were removed. After finishing ([FinisherSC](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv280)) and purging ([purge haplotigs](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2485-7)), the assembly was subjected to long read scaffolding using [SSPACE-long read](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-211) v1.1 and gap filling using [GapFinisher](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0216885). The assembly was then polished using PacBio reads with Arrow and using both short and long reads with [Pilon](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0112963). The assembly was also phased using [Freebayes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3907), [Whatshap](https://doi.org/10.1101/085050), and [Bcftools](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33590861). All scripts used to conduct the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/peterthorpe5/G.pallida_newton_assembly). The assembly was directly submitted to WormBase ParaSite by [Dr Peter Thorpe](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/peter-thorpe). Awaiting publication.
