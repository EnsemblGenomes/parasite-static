This assembly was generated from collection of preparasitic second-stage juveniles (J2) from Pa2-D383 _Globodera pallida_ line. Pa2-D383 is a relatively avirulent population from The Netherlands.

For the assembly, raw long [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) reads were corrected to, in essence, merge haplotypes using the correction mode in [CANU](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.215087.116). Using [wtdgb2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0669-3) version 2.3, multiple initial genome assemblies were generated. The contigs from the assemblies were then improved using [finishersc](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv280) version 2.1. Gaps in the assemblies were then filled using [gapfiller](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4627096) version 1.0. The resulting assembly was polished with PacBio reads by three iterations of arrow version 2.3.3, followed by five iterations of polishing with [pilon](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112963) version 1.23 using PacBio and [Illumina NovaSeq](https://emea.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/novaseq.html) short reads.
