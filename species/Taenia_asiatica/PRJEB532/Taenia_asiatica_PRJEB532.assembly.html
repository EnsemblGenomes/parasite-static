The draft genome assembly was produced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with Keeseon Eom (Department of Parasitology and Medical Research Institute, Parasite Resource Bank, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea) and Pete Olson (Natural History Museum, London) as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. The assembly uses Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction.
