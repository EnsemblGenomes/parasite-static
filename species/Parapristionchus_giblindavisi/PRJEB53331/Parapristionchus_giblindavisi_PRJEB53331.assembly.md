The genome was assembled using PacBio raw reads filtered for circular consensus sequencing (CCS) with >Q20 using PacBio [ccs](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs). The reads were merged using [pbmerge](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmerge) before being assembled with [Falcon-unzip2](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON_unzip). The assembly was polished using [pbmm2](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2).
