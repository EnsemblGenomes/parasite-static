The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Department of Biology at the Indiana University]([http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/](https://biology.indiana.edu/). The assembly uses Illumina NextSeq 300bp paired-end sequencing. [Minia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184257/) and [SPAdes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342519/) assemblers were used to perform a de-contaminated assembly.
