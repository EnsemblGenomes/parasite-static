_Halicephalobus_ is a clade of small, parthenogenic nematodes that have sometimes colonized remarkable habitats. _Halicephalobus_ species provide a point of comparison for parallelisms with other parthenogenic _panagrolaimid_ species in the evolution of asexuality. Given its molecular and geographic distinctness from other known _Halicephalobus_ strains, it is likely that the present strain (NKZ332) has an evolutionary fate separate from other nominal species. It is therefore presented as a new species: _Halicephalobus sp._ NKZ332.
