_Halicephalobus_ is a clade of small, parthenogenic nematodes that have sometimes colonized remarkable habitats. Given their phylogenetic closeness to other parthenogenic _panagrolaimid_ species with which they likely share a sexually reproducing ancestor, _Halicephalobus_ species provide a point of comparison for parallelisms in the evolution of asexuality. Given its molecular and geographic distinctness from other known _Halicephalobus_ strains, the present strain likely has an evolutionary fate separate from other nominal species. It Is therefore presented as a new species: _Halicephalobus sp._ NKZ332.
