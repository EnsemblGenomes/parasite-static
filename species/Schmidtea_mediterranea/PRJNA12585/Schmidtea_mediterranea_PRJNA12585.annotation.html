The original gene predictions were made by the <a href="http://www.stowers.org/">Stowers Institute</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17881371">Robb et al (2007)</a>. The gene models have since been iteratively improved. The version represented here is v1.3 from <a href="http://smedgd.stowers.org/index.html">SmedGD</a>.
