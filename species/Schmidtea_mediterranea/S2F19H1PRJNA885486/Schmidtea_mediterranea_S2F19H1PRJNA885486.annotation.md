The gene predictions were made by the [Department Rink](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/rink) at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/).

The transcript annotation was generated by a hybrid genome-guided approach relying on dedicated long-read [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) cDNA/dRNA sequencing runs and [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/) short-read and poly-adenylation data obtained by publically available datasets. After read quality trimming, deduplication, filtering, and mapping (using [HISAT](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.275193.120) and [minimap2](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191) for short and long reads, respectively), a draft transcriptome was generated using [Stringtie2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1910-1), then it was further refined using [FLAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15171-6) and a collection of custom scripts to filter high confidence isoforms.
