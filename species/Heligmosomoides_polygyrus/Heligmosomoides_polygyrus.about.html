The nematode <em>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</em> (formerly known as <em>Nematospiroides dubius</em>) is a common parasite found in the duodenum and small intestine of woodmice and other rodents. The laboratory strain that has been sequenced was originally isolated from Peromyscus in California (<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20729145">Behnke and Harris, 2010</a>); natural parasites from European wood mice (Apodemus sp.) are somewhat distinct, giving rise to some debate about the correct name and taxonomy of this species (<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16536883">Cable et al, 2006</a>; <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20729145">Behnke and Harris, 2010</a>; <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21159557">Maizels et al, 2010</a>), with suggestions that the laboratory strain is named <em>H. polygyrus bakeri</em> or <em>H. bakeri</em>, and the European strain <em>H. polygyrus polygyrus</em>. The laboratory strain has been maintained as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18432905">Camberis et al (2003)</a> and is often used to model human helminth infection as it can establish chronic infection in different strains of mice.
