The genome of _H. polygyrus_ was produced by the [Blaxter Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh](http://www.nematodes.org/). According to [Chow et al. (2019)](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30820541), the short-read Illumina data were assembled and gapfilled using [Platanus](http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp/), and scaffolded using transcriptome evidence with [SCUBAT2](https://github.com/GDKO/SCUBAT2). Long-read PacBio data were used to further scaffold and gapfill the assembly with [PBJelly](https://github.com/esrice/PBJelly).
