The gene predictions were produced by the [Blaxter Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh](http://www.nematodes.org/). According to [Chow et al. (2019)](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30820541), the [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) pipeline was used to predict protein-coding genes using the RNA-Seq reads as evidence. The [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) general feature format (gff) file and the transcriptome assembly within [MAKER2](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-491) were combined to predict untranslated regions of transcripts and remove low quality gene predictions.
