The nematode _Heligmosomoides polygyrus_ (formerly known as _Nematospiroides dubius_) is a common parasite found in the duodenum and small intestine of woodmice and other rodents. The laboratory strain that has been sequenced was originally isolated from Peromyscus in California ([Behnke and Harris, 2010](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20729145)); natural parasites from European wood mice (Apodemus sp.) are somewhat distinct, giving rise to some debate about the correct name and taxonomy of this species ([Cable et al, 2006](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16536883); [Behnke and Harris, 2010](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20729145); [Maizels et al, 2010](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21159557)), with suggestions that the laboratory strain is named _H. polygyrus bakeri_ or _H. bakeri_, and the European strain _H. polygyrus polygyrus_. The laboratory strain has been maintained as described by [Camberis et al (2003)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18432905) and is often used to model human helminth infection as it can establish chronic infection in different strains of mice.
