The original gene predictions were made by the [National University of Mexico](http://www.unam.mx/index/en), as described by [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966). The gene models have since been iteratively improved. The gene set represented here is the March 2014 snapshot from [GeneDB](http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Tsolium).
