The original gene predictions were made by the <a href="http://www.unam.mx/index/en">National University of Mexico</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966">Tsai et al (2013)</a>. The gene models have since been iteratively improved. The gene set represented here is the March 2014 snapshot from <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Tsolium">GeneDB</a>.
