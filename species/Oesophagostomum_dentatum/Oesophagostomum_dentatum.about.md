The nematode _Oesophagostomum dentatum_, or nodule worm, is a common parasite of domestic and feral pigs worldwide. Swine (_SusÂ scrofa_) is the only host and harbors hundreds and even thousands of pre-adult and adult stage worms in the large intestines, especially the caecum, for a long time period without clinical signs except reduced food conversion.
