The genome assembly was produced by the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/">Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University</a>, and submitted in late 2013 as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project.\n\nThe assembly presented here is similar to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000797555.1">GCA_000797555.1</a>, but it contains many additional small scaffolds that have been filtered out during submission.
