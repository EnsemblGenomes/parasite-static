The annotation was produced by running BRAKER, incorporating de novo gene predictions and RNASeq alignments, predicted on an unmasked assembly. The resulting predictions were then clustered using OrthoMCL and repeated predictions in low-complexity and repeat regions manually removed. A number of gene models were manually curated using Apollo.
