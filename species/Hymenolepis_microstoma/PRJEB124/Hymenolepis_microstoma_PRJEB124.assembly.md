The _H.Â microstoma_ genome was sequenced by the [Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with [Pete Olson](http://www.olsonlab.com/) (Natural History Museum, London). The initial version of the genome was described in [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966). ParaSite releases 5-11 (January 2016 to October 2018) presented the November 2015 snapshot from [GeneDB](http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Hmicrostoma), corresponding to INSDC assembly [HMIC002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000469805.2/). Assembly presented here is the third consecutive version of the assembly, created by scaffolding a de novo PacBio assembly using Bionano's hybrid scaffolder (optical mapping). Further improvement was then carried out in gap5 using all the available optical map and sequence data. Manuscript in preparation.
