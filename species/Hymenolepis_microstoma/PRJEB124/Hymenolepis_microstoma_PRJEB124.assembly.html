The <em>H.&nbsp;microstoma</em> genome was sequenced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.olsonlab.com/">Pete Olson</a> (Natural History Museum, London). The initial version of the genome was described in <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966">Tsai et al (2013)</a>. ParaSite releases 5-11 (January 2016 to October 2018) presented the November 2015 snapshot from <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Hmicrostoma">GeneDB</a>, corresponding to INSDC assembly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000469805.2/">HMIC002</a>. Assembly presented here is the third consecutive version of the assembly, created by scaffolding a de novo PacBio assembly using Bionano's hybrid scaffolder (optical mapping). Further improvement was then carried out in gap5 using all the available optical map and sequence data. Manuscript in preparation.
