The cestode _Hymenolepis microstoma_, or rodent tapeworm, is an intestinal dwelling parasite of mice and rats. Adult worms live in the bile duct and small intestines, and larvae metamorphose in the haemocoel of beetles. _H.Â microstoma_ is prevalent in rodents worldwide causing hymenolepiasis, but rarely infects humans. It is used as a laboratory model organism.
