The draft genome assembly was produced by the [Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with Warwick Grant (La Trobe University), using Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction, followed by some bespoke manual improvement (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, [Hunt et al. (2016)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26829753)).\n

\n\nIn May 2019 Eerik Aunin reported that the genome could be contaminated with bacteria. He observed that the average GC content of scaffold peaks once around 25% and a second time around 70%. Additionally, 685 of 1810 scaffolds, almost exclusively with GC% corresponding to the second peak, are reported as bacterial in an nt BLAST against a reference bacterial database. 483 of the scaffolds match genus _Brevundimonas_ of protobacteria, and others match about 30 different bacteria.
