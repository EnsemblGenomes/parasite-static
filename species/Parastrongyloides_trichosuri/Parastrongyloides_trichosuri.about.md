The nematode _Parastrongyloides trichosuri_ is an intestinal parasite of Australian Brush-tailed possums. This parasite has the capacity to undergo multiple reproductive cycles as a free-living worm and thereby amplify the numbers of its infective L3s in faeces. This unique feature makes _P.Â trichosuri_ a model for studies that explore the genetic basis of longevity and parasitism.
