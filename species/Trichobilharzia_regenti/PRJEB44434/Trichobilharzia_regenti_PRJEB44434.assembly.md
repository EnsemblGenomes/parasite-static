This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C.
  
The source material for genome sequencing was a pool of single-miracidium derived cercariae, from the Czech Republic in 2014, provided by Roman Leontovyč and Petr Horák from [Charles University, Prague](https://cuni.cz/).
