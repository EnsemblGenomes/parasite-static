_Caenorhabditis inopinata_ (_sp. 34_) is a free-living, transparent nematode, isolated from fresh syconia of the fig Ficus septica in Ishigaki island, Japan. It is among the closest known relatives of C. elegans, while also displaying a number of characteristic differences related to the timing of developmental milestones and body size. This has created interest in the species as a system of study of evolutionary diversification.
