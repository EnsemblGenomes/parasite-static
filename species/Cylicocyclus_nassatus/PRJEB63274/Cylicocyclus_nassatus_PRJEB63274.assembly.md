The full assembly process is outlined in [Salle et al., (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.19.549683v1). HiFi data was adaptor-trimmed and filtered for low-quality reads. Genome assembly graphs were produced using [HiFiasm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01056-5) (v0.16.1). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using the [mitoHiFi](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521667v2.full) v2.2 software, feeding quality filtered HiFi reads and the C. nassatus reference mitogenome as a backbone.
