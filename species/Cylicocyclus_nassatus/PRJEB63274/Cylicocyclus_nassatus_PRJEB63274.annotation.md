The full annotation process is outlined in [Salle et al., (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.19.549683v1). Gene annotation was conducted with the [EnTAP](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13106) software, to assign homology information from the [EggNOG](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/D1/D389/6833261?login=true) database, and protein domain information from [PFAM](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/D1/D412/5943818) and [InterPro](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/D1/D418/6814474) databases.
