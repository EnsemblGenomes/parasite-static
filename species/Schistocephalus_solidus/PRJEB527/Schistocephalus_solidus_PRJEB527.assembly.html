The draft genome assembly was produced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/15825/group_parasitology/">Martin Kalbe (Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology)</a> as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes project. The assembly uses Illumina paired-end sequencing followed by an in-house genome assembly pipeline comprising various steps, including contig assembly, scaffolding, gap-filling and error-correction.
