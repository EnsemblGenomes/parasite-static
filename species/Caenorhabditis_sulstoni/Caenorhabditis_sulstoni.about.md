_Caenorhabditis sulstoni_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 32_) was formally described by [Stevens et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. It is a member of the _Japonica_ group in the _Caenorhabditis_ genus; molecular data suggest its closest known relative to be _C. afra_. It reproduces through males and females. The species type isolate was collected from the faeces of an East African millipede (_Archispirostreptus gigas_) bought in spring 2013 at an insect market in Berlin. The species is named in honour of John Sulston, for his work on the _C. elegans_ cell lineage and genome sequence.
