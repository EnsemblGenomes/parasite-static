The gene predictions were originally made by the [Gasser group at the University of Melbourne](http://www.gasserlab.org/), as described by [Young et al (2012)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22246508). A cleaned-up version of the annotation was subsequently deposited in the INSDC (assembly SchHae_1.0), and is shown here.
