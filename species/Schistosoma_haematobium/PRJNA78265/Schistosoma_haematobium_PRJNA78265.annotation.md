Gene models were generated using a pipeline incorporating MAKER2, EVM, and transfer from the previous "Shae.V1" gene set using liftOver and RATT. The annotation is described in full by [Stroehlein et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31494670/). The gene-set presented here for the Shae. V3, was generated transferring 6277 high-confidence gene models (i.e. 67.4%) from Shae.V2 to Shae.V3, and inferred 3154 more genes based on evidence from mapped long and short RNA sequence reads from all key developmental stages and both sexes of S. haematobium, as described in full by [Stroehlein et al., 2022](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/35167626).
