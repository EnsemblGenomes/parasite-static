The gene predictions were originally made by the <a href="http://www.gasserlab.org/">Gasser group at the University of Melbourne</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22246508">Young et al (2012)</a>. A cleaned-up version of the annotation was subsequently deposited in the INSDC (assembly SchHae_1.0), and is shown here.
