This annotated genome assembly was produced as part of the doctoral thesis of Duncan Berger: [Berger, D. (2021). Comparative and population genomic analyses of the parasitic blood flukes (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86667).
  
The assembly was generated from [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) long-read sequencing data and scaffolded using Hi-C.
  
The source material for genome sequencing was three single-miracidium-derived adult female worms (Egypt strain), provided by Ron Hokke and Anna Kildemoes from [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/medicine-lumc), the Netherlands. Additional worms from the same collection were used for gene finding.
