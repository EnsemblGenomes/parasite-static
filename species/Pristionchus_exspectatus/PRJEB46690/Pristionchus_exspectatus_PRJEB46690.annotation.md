According to [Yoshida K, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01980-z), gene annotation was generated by the [Perl Package for Customized Annotation Computing annotation pipeline](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7992802) (version 1.0): [A transcriptome assembly of P. exspectatus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01980-z#ref-CR38) and the [community-curated P. pacificus gene annotation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552371) (version El Paco gene annotation 3) were aligned against the P. exspectatus de novo assembly with the help of the [exonerate alignment tool](https://doi.org/10.1186%2F1471-2105-6-31) (version 2.2.0), and the longest open reading frames per 100â€‰bp windows were chosen as representative gene models.
