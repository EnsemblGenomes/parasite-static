According to [Yoshida K, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01980-z), evidence-based gene annotation for P. exspectatus was generated by the Perl Package for Customized Annotation Computing annotation pipeline73 (version 1.0).  a transcriptome assembly of P. exspectatus and the community-curated P. pacificus gene annotation (version El Paco gene annotation 3) were aligned against the P. exspectatus de novo assembly with the help of the exonerate alignment tool (version 2.2.0), and the longest open reading frames per 100â€‰bp windows were chosen as representative gene models (see ref. 73 for further details).
