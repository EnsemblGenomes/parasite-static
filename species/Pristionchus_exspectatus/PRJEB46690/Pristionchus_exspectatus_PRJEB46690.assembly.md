This assembly was generated from an inbred line of the type strain of _P. exspectatus_, RS5522B.

According to [Yoshida K, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01980-z), Raw long sequencing PacBio reads were assembled using the [Canu](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411767) assembler. The assembly was processed by [HaploMerger2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870766) to build the haploid genome. The resulting assembly was scaffolded using Hi-C scaffolding.
