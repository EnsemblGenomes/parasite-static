_Caenorhabditis quiockensis_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 38_) was formally described by [Stevens et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019.  Molecular data suggest its closest known relatives to be _C. dolens_, _C. castelli_ and _C. angaria_. It reproduces through males and females. The species type isolate was collected from a rotting fruit in Guadeloupe in 2014.
