<i>Caenorhabditis briggsae</i> is a small, free-living roundworm found in decaying plant material especially compost and mushroom beds in temperate regions throughout the world. The worms feed on the bacteria and other microorganisms associated with plant decay. The biology of <i>C. briggsae</i> is similar to that of <i>C. elegans</i>, with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. <i>C. briggsae</i> is hermaphroditic like <i>C. elegans</i> and distinct from the other sequenced worms which have both male and female adult animals. <i>C. briggsae</i> is often found at the same site as both <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. remanei</i>. <i>C. briggsae</i> is frequently found associated with snails that are presumed to transport worms, especially the dormant dauer stage, from one location to another.
