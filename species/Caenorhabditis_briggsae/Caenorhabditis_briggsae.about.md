_Caenorhabditis briggsae_ is a small, free-living roundworm found in decaying plant material especially compost and mushroom beds in temperate regions throughout the world. The worms feed on the bacteria and other microorganisms associated with plant decay. The biology of _C. briggsae_ is similar to that of _C. elegans_, with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. _C. briggsae_ is hermaphroditic like _C. elegans_ and distinct from the other sequenced worms which have both male and female adult animals. _C. briggsae_ is often found at the same site as both _C. elegans_ and _C. remanei_. _C. briggsae_ is frequently found associated with snails that are presumed to transport worms, especially the dormant dauer stage, from one location to another.
