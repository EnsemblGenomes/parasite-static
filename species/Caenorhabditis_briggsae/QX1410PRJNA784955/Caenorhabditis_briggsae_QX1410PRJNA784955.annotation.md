Protein-coding gene predictions using [BRAKER](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9011032/#evac042-B46) v2.1.6. Short RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the genome and the alignments were provided to the BRAKER pipeline. Long PacBio RNA-Seq reads were generated and aligned to the genome to generate high-quality transcripts (IsoSeq) which were used to perform transcriptome assembly using [minimap2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137996/) and [StringTie](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912988/) v2.1.2. [AGAT](https://doi.org/10.5281%2Fzenodo.5834795) was used to extract gne models from the transcriptome assembly. These models were merged with the BRAKER models.
