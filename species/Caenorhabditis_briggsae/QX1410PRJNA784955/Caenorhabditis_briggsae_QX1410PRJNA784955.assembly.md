This chromosome-leve assembly was generated from the _C. briggsae_ QX1410, a new reference strain closely related to the laboratory AF16 strain.
  
[Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) long-reads were assembled using [Canu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411767/) r10117, [Flye](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30936562) v2.8.1-b1676 and [wtdbg2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004874/) v0.0. The ONT reads were aligned to the Flye assemblies using [minimap2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137996/) v2.17-r941 and error-correction was performed. [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) v1.1.2 was used to correct sequencing errors. Remaining sequencing errors were corrected by aligning a paired-end Illumina dataset to the assemblies using [bwa](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3997) mem v0.7.17-r1188 (Li 2013) and providing the resulting alignments to [Pilon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237348/) v1.23.
