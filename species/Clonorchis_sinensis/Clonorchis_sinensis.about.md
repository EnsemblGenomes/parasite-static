The trematode _ClonorchisÂ sinensis_, or Chinese liver fluke, is a parasitic human liver fluke. The parasite lives in the liver of humans, is believed to be the third most prevalent worm parasite in the world, and is endemic to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Recent studies have proved that it is capable of causing cancer of liver and bile duct, and in fact the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classed it as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009.
