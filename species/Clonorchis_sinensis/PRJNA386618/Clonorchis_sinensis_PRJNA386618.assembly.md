The chromosome-level assembly presented here was added in WormBase ParaSite release 16, and represents version 2 of [GCA_003604175](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_003604175). The assembly was generated by scaffolding version 1 of the assembly with Hi-C data, paired-end and mate-pair libraries and Oxford Nanopore long-read libraries, as described by [Young et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33677057/).
