The genome of a male _T.Â suis_ isolate (strain DCEP-RM93M) was sequenced by the [Gasser laboratory at the University of Melbourne](http://www.gasserlab.org/), as described by [Jex et al (2014)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24929829). The assembly version represented here was submitted directly to WormBase in early 2014.
