The nematode _Trichuris suis_, or whipworm, is a parasite of pigs that is found worldwide, but is most prevalent in warm, humid climates. Critical infestations of _T. suis_ may cause acute morbidity and mortality in young female pigs. _T.Â suis_ has been shown in trials to colonize humans briefly without triggering infections.
