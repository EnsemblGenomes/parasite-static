_Caenorhabditis waitukubuli_ (formerly _Caenorhabditis sp. 39_) was formally described by [Stevens et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007946/) in 2019. It reproduces through males and females. Molecular data suggest that its closest relatives are _C. yunquensis_, _C. macrosperma_, _C. nouraguensis_, _C. becei_, and _C. panamensis_. The species type isolate was collected from a rotting fruit collected in Morne Trois Pitons, Dominica in 2014.
