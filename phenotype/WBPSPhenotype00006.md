# In vitro attachment assayed, no phenotype observed
[Wang et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32973031/) treated adult male and female pairs with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) _in vitro_. Worm attachment to the culture flask was assayed. No detachment phenotype was reported for dsRNA constructs targeting these genes.
