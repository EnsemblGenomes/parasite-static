# EdU incorporation assayed, no phenotype observed
[Wang et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32973031/) treated adult male and female pairs with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) _in vitro_. After 30 days, the maintenance of neoblasts and germinal stem cells was assayed by labeling parasites with the thymidine analogue ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU). For these genes, no EdU-incorporation defect was detected.
